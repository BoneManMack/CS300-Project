This project is intended to allow the advising program at a fictional University to load a CSV file containing a list of courses including course number, course name, and up to 2 prerequisites. 

The program loads each row of the CSV file and writes the data to an object. The objects are then stored in a linked list.

The user may print all courses in the list in alphanumeric order, search for specific course by course number.

As I approached the problem I I went with the parts that I knew how to make work first so I could spend the majority of my time trying to figure out how to parse the CSV file. I've run into consistent issues with the parsing files we were supplied with in previous assignments. After struggling for 2 days to make my own CSV parsing functions I reworked my code to be compatible with the boilerplate code supplied in previous assignments. Unfortunately, I still can't seem to make the code work and I had to surrender to fate. 

Any advice on making a CSV parsing file would be appreciated.

I have enjoyed working with data structures I look forward to working more with these types of functions in the future. I'm particularly fond of binary search trees for the speed of their search.

This project has made me reevaluate my skills with code. I couldn't get any IDE to compile the CSV functions which always resulted in LNK2019 errors. It just feels like there's something I'm missing.
